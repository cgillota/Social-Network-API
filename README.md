  ## Description
   
  This is a Node.js application programming interface (API) that allows users to perform CRUD operations on social networking data models using a NoSQL database. The data models include friends, users, thoughts, and reaction data models, and they can be retrieved by ID or all of them. This API is built using Node.js and Mongoose, and it provides a simple and scalable way to handle social networking data without the restrictions of traditional relational databases.
